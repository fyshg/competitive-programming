My Solutions and custom made test cases to 11 Weeks of Competitive Programming challenges. 

As Speed (as in runtime and time to complete the tasks) is very important for this discipline, 
some unorthodox and seemingly weird programming techniques might have been used that may impair readability. 
Tasks are usually named from a to e, corresponding to up to 6 weekly tasks. Custom test cases for tasks are named input + the letter of the corresponding tasks.

Due to performance, most solutions use C++. In some, Java is used for its BigNumber libraries (BigInteger and BigDecimal).
